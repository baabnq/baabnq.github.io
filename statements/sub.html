        <p>Push the next execution address onto the stack and writes the address at which labelA is defined to the execution register. Effectively, this calls a routine.</p>

        <p>
        Evaluates condition cond, then push the next execution address onto the stack and writes the address at which labelA is defined to the execution register if cond was evaluated truthfully.
