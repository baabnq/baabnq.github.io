    <h1>About Baabnq</h1>

        <h2>Too Fake</h2>

Baabnq (pronounced /b&#594;&#8203;&#720;&#8203;&#331;k/) is a low-level, untyped, statically compiled programming language and programming ecosystem.
Baabnq aims to strike a balance between being generic and therefore portable and easy to implement a processor or virtual machine for, 
but also still efficient enough to be actually practical and usable.
It provides named variables, higher-order expressions, memory management, and a plethora of standard routines and utilities.
Usually it is directly compiled down to S1Asm, which can then be run on a processor or virtual machine, with no linking or other encoding steps involved.
Baabnq may also be used as an educational tool to give insight into compilers, processors, and low-level development in general.

        <h2>Too Real</h2>

Baabnq is a just a homebrew programming language, that i develop for fun.
Baabnq does not have any direct practical value.
It does however have an interesting set of features and modules.
You could consider it "art", if you're pretentious enough.
It's like one of those ecosystem-in-a-jar. Self-contained, fairly useless, but still cool.
Baabnq is a personal project. It's close to my heart. It's my language.
