    <h1>About Baabnq</h1>
    <div class="page">
        <p class="embed">
Baabnq is a low-level, untyped, statically compiled programming language and programming ecosystem.
Baabnq aims to strike a balance between being generic and therefore portable and easy to implement a processor or virtual machine for, 
but also still efficient enough to be actually practical and usable.
Baabnq provides named variables, higher-order expressions, memory management, and a plethora of standard routines and utilities.
Baabnq may also be used as an educational tool to give insight into compilers, processors, and low-level development in general.
It compiles directly down to S1Asm, which can then be run on a processor or virtual machine, with no linking or other encoding steps involved.
