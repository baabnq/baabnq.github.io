            <h1>Representation</h1>
            <p>
                This page contains symbols, that represent Baabnq.
                They mostly act to build the visual identity of Baabnq.
                And also, i needed an excuse to do some graphic design / pixel art.
                So don't take this page too seriously. :3
            </p>

            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>
                This is the official Baabnq logo,
                which is obviously inspired by the C logo,
                as the two languages are quite similar.
                Also, there's no deeper reason as to why it looks specifically like this.
                I just picked light shades of blue, because they look pretty.
            </p>
            <div class="embed">
                <img src="/pics/logo.png"/>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Mascot</h2>
            <p>
                This is Sapphire, the mascot of Baabnq. <br>
                They're a striped domestic cat, with blue fur and amber eyes.
                The shades of their blue fur match the logo. Thus they are bound to Baabnq.
                Canonically, they are very cute and love headpats.
