        <h1>Temp Pool</h1>

        <p>
The Temp Pool is a collection of statically allocated memory addresses, the quantity of which is computed prior to code generation.
It serves to provide temporary storage space that is only valid within the scope of machine code emitted by a singular statement.
This local space is also directly accessible to the program through the <a href="../statements/asm.html">inline assembler preprocessor</a>.
