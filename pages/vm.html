        <p>
            The Virtual Machine that Baabnq runs on is a fully 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture">Harvard architecture</a> virtual processor.
            It can address a 16-bit general purpose memory and 16-bit stack, both with a size of 65k.
            It has one accumulator register, the "acc", and one general purpose register, the "reg".
            Special purpose registers include the execution register, which tracks the instruction being executed, and the stack pointer, which tracks the top of the stack.
            Both of them are not directly accessible.
            Additionally, the VM manages the heap in the upper half of general purpose memory.
