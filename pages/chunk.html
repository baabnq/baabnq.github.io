        <p>
            Chunks are groups of memory allocated on the heap and managed by the Virtual Machine.
            Chunks are always prefixed by their length, which immediately precedes the base pointer.
            When a chunk is allocated, it is zeroed out.
            See <a href="/pages/vm.html">Virtual Machine</a>.
